              <p>Welcome to my page! I was born in Queens, New York about 24 years ago. I moved to New Jersey when I was 2 years old.
                 I've lived in the same house since! My parents and sister were born and raised in India. I'm the first American baby of the family.
                 My sister is a solid ten years older than me. She has her own little family with a husband and an adorable 3 year old daughter. 
                 In 2019 I graduated from Rutgers University (clearly I cant get enough of the place) with a degree in Women and Gender Studies.
                 I had to write an Honors Thesis which truly was the death of me. Since then, I began the Coding Bootcamp Program at Rutgers. 
                 I also am doing a tattoo apprenticeship. The ultimate dream is to be a coder by day and tattoo artist by night! Wish me luck on that one.
                 For fun, I do a lot of painting, drawing, dancing, and yoga. Although in the midst of the pandemic my hobbies have turned into sleeping and snacking.
